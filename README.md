# Important note

At first, we started working only Oren and Roie. Yuval was assigned to another group that resigned from the course so she joined us later on. Yuval is also in active reserve duty
therefore during the work process, there were times where she was not available and she couldn't work as much as we did. Therefore, part of the merges and commits were done without her "agreement". When she joined us, we discussed with Hemi and according to his recommendation we gave her parts of the projects which were on her own responsibility, so she can learn and contribute to the projects in her own time.
Regarding the late submit, we tried our best to balance the progress in the project, letting Yuval close the gap and learn while in reserve duty, and also Roie who was in reserve during last semester's exam period and therefore had to take exams at the beginning of the current semester.
Thanks for your understanding.

# Running the application

## React

To run the react project, first you need to go to the "client" directory. When running in the first time, write in the terminal "npm i". When that finishes, write "npm start" to run the react app. For later uses you can skip "npm i".

## Android

For the android, you need to either open the android emulator or install the application in your mobile device, and press the start button in the android studio work frame.

## Workflow

First we started by creating a scrum sprint for the react part, where we created the basic tasks needed for the entire react part.
We split the job equally so both of us worked on the initial part of the project.
From the second day on, we tried to follow the following work pattern:

1. Short zoom meeting in the start of every work day, where we discussed yesterday's advancements and defined missions for the upcoming day.
2. During the day, we discussed on changing times about issues and problems that came up.
3. For every page we :
   a. first layed down the basic foundation on the page and made sure the functionality works.
   b. Added minimal styling.
   c. Finished up the functionality.
   d. Added tasks to the jira for each problem that came up.
   e. Testing how the page fits the entire application.
   f. Finishing touches on the styling.
   When finished all the pages, we ran some tests, and made changes according to the needs.
   When we finished with the react part completely, we started working on the android part, on the same way.
